Project Title: Simulating Weighted Dice Rolls in R

Introduction:
This project involves creating R code to simulate rolling a pair of dice, similar to a craps table. To make things more engaging, we'll modify the dice to be slightly weighted in our favor. Through this project, I will:

Explore the R and RStudio interfaces.
Execute R commands and create objects.
Develop custom functions and scripts.
Utilize R packages.
Generate random samples and simulate probabilities.
Visualize results with quick plots.
Learn how to access Râ€™s built-in help resources.
This project serves as an introduction to R programming, helping to build foundational skills in statistical simulation and data visualization.
