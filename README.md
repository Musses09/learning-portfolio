📌 Welcome to My Bioinformatics Portfolio!

Introduction

Welcome to my Bioinformatics Portfolio! This repository serves as a record of my personal and academic growth as I transition from a background in Biomedical Science to the dynamic world of Bioinformatics.

After completing my bachelor's degree, I pursued a master's in Bioinformatics to expand my computational and statistical skills, aiming to become a more well-rounded scientist. My passion lies in epidemiological studies, and I embraced the challenge of exploring this field—one that initially felt unfamiliar—to bridge the gap between biological research and computational analysis.

Through this journey, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to public health and epidemiological research, ensuring that my skills and knowledge become valuable assets in addressing real-world challenges.

📜 About This Repository

Here, you'll find a curated selection of projects that reflect my academic coursework, research interests, and professional aspirations. These projects highlight my skills in:

🔬 Biological sequence analysis (DNA, RNA, and protein data)

🧬 Variant calling workflows (e.g., SAMtools, Conda pipelines)

🏗 Algorithm development for bioinformatics tasks

📊 UMAP and dimensionality reduction techniques for single-cell data analysis

Each project is structured to demonstrate my programming proficiency, analytical thinking, and dedication to solving complex biological problems through computational methods.

🛠 Technologies & Programming Languages

This repository focuses on leveraging computational tools to tackle bioinformatics challenges using:

Programming Languages:

Python 🐍: Core language for genomic analysis, data preprocessing, and bioinformatics algorithm development.

R 📊: Statistical analysis and visualization of biological datasets.

SQL 🗄️: Querying and managing biological databases.

Bash 💻: Workflow automation for large-scale genomic data processing.

I hope this serves as both a portfolio of my expertise and an open space for collaboration with like-minded researchers and bioinformaticians.
