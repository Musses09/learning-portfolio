My Coding Journey: Bioinformatics & Computational Biology

ðŸ“œ About This Repository
Welcome to my Bioinformatics & Computational Biology portfolio! This repository is a log of my progress as I learn Python and develop key skills in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data science. It serves as a personal record of the coding challenges, exercises, and projects Iâ€™ve completed, all aimed at building a solid foundation for my future career in scientific research.

The purpose of this repository is to track my journey in mastering programming languages and tools used in bioinformatics, particularly Python, and to demonstrate my growing expertise in areas such as genomic data analysis, bioinformatics algorithms, and computational biology workflows.

As I continue to develop my skills, I will expand this repository to include more advanced topics and projects, including those focused on R and other programming languages, as well as real-world applications in bioinformatics.

ðŸ§¬ Technologies & Languages
I am focusing on the following tools and languages to solve bioinformatics and computational biology problems:

Programming Languages:
Python: The primary language for my bioinformatics projects, used for genomic data analysis, data manipulation, and implementing bioinformatics algorithms.
R: Used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and working with bioinformatics-specific packages (e.g., Bioconductor).
Bash: Writing scripts to automate workflows and process large datasets commonly encountered in bioinformatics.

ðŸ“š Areas of Focus
My current focus areas as I develop my skills in computational biology and bioinformatics include:

Genomic Data Analysis: Analyzing RNA-Seq, DNA-Seq, and microarray data using Python and R to extract meaningful biological insights.
Statistical Bioinformatics: Applying statistical methods to biological data for tasks such as differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment.
Pipeline Development & Automation: Developing scripts and tools to automate bioinformatics workflows, ensuring reproducibility and efficiency in data processing.

Machine Learning in Bioinformatics: Exploring the application of machine learning algorithms for tasks like protein structure prediction and biomarker discovery.
Bioinformatics Algorithms: Implementing key algorithms for sequence alignment, variant calling, and biological data interpretation.

ðŸš€ Projects
This repository contains a mix of coding challenges, tasks, and personal projects Iâ€™ve completed during my learning journey. The focus so far has been on Python, but I will be adding tasks and projects related to R and other tools in the near future. Each folder represents a distinct project or set of tasks related to bioinformatics and computational biology, from data analysis scripts to full-scale computational pipelines.

ðŸŒ± Goals & Plans
As I continue to grow in bioinformatics and computational biology, here are my future goals:

Expand My Knowledge: Deepen my understanding of advanced bioinformatics topics such as single-cell RNA sequencing, systems biology, and integrative omics approaches.

Publish and Share: Document my progress and share my findings, algorithms, and pipelines to make bioinformatics more accessible and reproducible.

Pursue Professional Opportunities: Apply for roles such as Computational Biologist, Bioinformatician, Data Scientist, or Research Scientist within biological research or healthcare industries.
