My Coding Journey

ðŸ“œ About This Repository
Welcome to my Bioinformatics & Computational Biology portfolio! This repository showcases the projects, coding challenges, and technical exercises I've completed during my Masterâ€™s program in Bioinformatics. The goal is to demonstrate my progress and technical abilities in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data science, focusing on solving complex biological problems using computational approaches.

This repository is intended for roles such as Computational Biologist, Bioinformatician, and other positions that require a strong foundation in coding, data analysis, and bioinformatics techniques.

ðŸ§¬ Technologies & Languages
I am currently focused on the following tools and languages to tackle bioinformatics problems:

Programming Languages:
Python: Used for genomic data analysis, data manipulation, and bioinformatics algorithms.
R: Employed for statistical analysis, data visualization, and bioinformatics-specific packages (e.g., Bioconductor).
Bash: Writing command-line scripts to automate bioinformatics workflows and process large datasets.

Bioinformatics Tools:

Data Analysis Tools:
Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio: For interactive analysis and visualization.
Git/GitHub: Version control and collaboration.

ðŸ“š Areas of Focus
I am currently building expertise in the following areas of computational biology and bioinformatics:

Genomic Data Analysis: Using Python and R for large-scale data analysis, including RNA-Seq, DNA-Seq, and microarray data.
Statistical Bioinformatics: Applying statistical techniques to biological data, such as differential gene expression analysis, survival analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis.
Pipeline Development & Automation: Developing command-line tools and Bash scripts to automate bioinformatics workflows, improve data processing efficiency, and ensure reproducibility.
Machine Learning in Bioinformatics: Exploring machine learning algorithms to model biological processes, such as protein structure prediction, biomarker discovery, and data clustering.
