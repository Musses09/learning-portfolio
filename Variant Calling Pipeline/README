Your objective is to analyze sequencing data by mapping reads and identifying genetic variants across three samples. Follow the steps below carefully:

Task Breakdown:

1.Map the Reads & Call Variants
Align the sequencing reads to a reference genome for all three samples.
Perform variant calling to identify genetic differences in each sample.
Save the commands you used in a text file.

2.Analyse the Variant Call Files (VCFs)
Examine the VCF files generated from the variant calling step.
Identify if one sample appears different from the others.
Explain which sample is different and why you think it stands out.

3.Hypothesis & Explanation
Based on your findings, propose a possible explanation for why the sample differs.
Consider factors like sequencing errors, contamination, mutations, or sample mix-ups.
